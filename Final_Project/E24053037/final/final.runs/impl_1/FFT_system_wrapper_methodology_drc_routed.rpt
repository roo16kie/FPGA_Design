2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.077 ns between FFT_system_i/FFT_0/inst/FFT_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/slv_reg7_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and FFT_system_i/FFT_0/inst/FFT_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/nolabel_line539/yr_reg[5]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.091 ns between FFT_system_i/FFT_0/inst/FFT_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/slv_reg7_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and FFT_system_i/FFT_0/inst/FFT_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/nolabel_line539/yi_reg[6]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.178 ns between FFT_system_i/FFT_0/inst/FFT_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/slv_reg7_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and FFT_system_i/FFT_0/inst/FFT_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/nolabel_line539/yr_reg[7]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.452 ns between FFT_system_i/FFT_0/inst/FFT_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/slv_reg7_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and FFT_system_i/FFT_0/inst/FFT_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/nolabel_line539/yr_reg[8]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#5 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.638 ns between FFT_system_i/FFT_0/inst/FFT_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/slv_reg7_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and FFT_system_i/FFT_0/inst/FFT_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/nolabel_line539/yi_reg[8]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#6 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.644 ns between FFT_system_i/FFT_0/inst/FFT_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/slv_reg7_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and FFT_system_i/FFT_0/inst/FFT_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/nolabel_line539/yi_reg[7]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
